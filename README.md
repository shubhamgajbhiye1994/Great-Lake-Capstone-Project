# Great-Lake-Capstone-Project
Capstone Project - Pneumonia Detection and Localiazation


Please find below steps

1) First download data from below kaggle source
   https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data

2) Extract Data in your folder and copy-paste the below file in given folder
   stage_2_test_images,stage_2_train_images
   stage_2_train_labels,stage_2_sample_submission,
   stage_2_detailed_class_info

3) if you are trying to run the code on local-machine (using GPU)
   activate your GPU env.
   Analys the images run - CAPSTONE-EDA.ipynb
   & to train n predict test images run - Densenet121_unet.ipynb,Mobilenet_unet.ipynb
                                          MaskRCNN.ipynb
   
   note : if path error comes please change paths mentions in model files 
          Also try to use google colab for more effective utilization of GPU and RAM
